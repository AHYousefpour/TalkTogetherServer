# TalkTogetherServer
This is a server side program TalkTogether. 
A maximum of 1024 clients can connect to this server at the same time, so that they can send messages to each other, just like a group in messengers.
The poll method is used in this code and it can handle all clients simultaneously.
This code is just an aspect of showing my skills, I used the concepts of solid, clean code, etc. in this code.
#this project can only compile and run on linux.
